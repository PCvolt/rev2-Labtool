# GGxrd rev2 Labtool
External tool which adds more features to the training mode of Guilty Gear Xrd Rev2.

## How to use
1. Boot up GGxrd
2. Boot up Labtool, go to Practice Mode, put the cursor on 'Block Type' and then close the menu

## Features
- Frame advantage (even after Roman Cancels!)
- Gap counter in P1's blockstrings (up to 30F gaps)

## Known bugs
- Attacks such as blitz or Ramlethal 5PPP haved a recovery animation which is not considered "idle" but can be cancelled as if it were an idle animation. To display the proper frame advantage from those attacks, cancel the recovery with walk.
